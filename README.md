Goal 12: "Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns"

# Project idea
This project will enable people to contribute to responsible consumption of goods in an appealing way by allowing them to trade goods that no longer hold value to them with others in the community where it may hold value rather then sending it to the dump. 

# Project background/Business Opportunity
Taking inspiration from the saying: "one man's trash is another man's treasure', the intent on this project is to support those in the community that are in financial need and don't wish to throw out things that they don't need but they still hold value. This application will allow easy trading within the community and support responsible consumption of goods by giving it to someone in need rather than sending it to a landfill.

Instead of throwing out a bag of clothes that don’t fit you anymore, why not trade it with someone that no longer fits the size that you need? Or given the chance that you have a lot of unused diapers
that you will no longer need, there is definitely someone out there that is desperate to find diapers but can’t afford it. This is the opportunity that this application will target. Our 'Why' is to create a sustainable, community-driven trading platform that empowers people to reduce waste and promote responsible consumption. This will be achieve this by providing an intuitive and user-friendly interface for effortless item listings and connecting the community to responsibly trade items.
